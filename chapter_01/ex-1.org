1. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the
   following operations would take:
- Reading
  1 step
- Searching for a value not contained within the array
  100 steps
- Insertion at the beginning of the array
  100 (shifting to right) + 1 (inserting) = 101 steps
- Insertion at the end of the array
  1 step
- Deletion at the beginning of the array
  1 (deletion) + 99 (moving to fill the gap) = 100 steps
- Deletion at the end of the array
  1 step

=For an array-based set containing 100 elements, provide the number of
steps the following operations would take=
- Reading :: 1 step
- Searching for a value not contained within the array :: 100 steps
- Insertion of a new value at the beginning of the set :: 100
  (searching for duplicates) + 100 (shifting to right) + 1 (insertion)
  = 201 steps
- Insertion of a new value at the end of the set :: 100 (searching for
  duplicates) + 1 (insertion) = 101 steps
- Deletion at the beginning of the set :: 1 (deletion) + 99 (moving to
  left) = 100 steps
- Deletion at the end of the set :: 1 step

Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance
of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance
of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the
value “apple” is found inside an array. How many steps would it take
to find all the “apples”? Give your answer in terms of N.

A: N steps, as we need to do complete search until the end of the array
